Backend Api for a class project.

Backend database and API controller for a group project.
The main challenge came from the fact that this was to be a 2 person team project
but due to an odd number of students I was building a backend for 2 different Frontend students.
Both of them had different thoughts and demands for what I would be providing them. The instructors challenged 
me to solve it using just a single backend for both of my teammates. 

###Skills I used and learned for this project.
* Java 
* JPA 
* Spring 
* Spring boot
* Postgresql
* Heroku
